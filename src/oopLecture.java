    //    ================================= OOP =================================
    //A way to organize code, especially for larger/more complex programs.
//-- UP TO NOW --
// - mostly programming in an imperative way both in JS and Java
// - written code where variable values are changed by various statements and functions/methods
//-- DEFINITION --
//  OOP - Object-oriented programming
//  - A programming paradigm where state (data/properties) and behavior (functionality/methods)
//    are grouped together (often into objects)
//  - Objects in Java are created from classes (a blueprint for an object/instance)
//**See PB&J**
//-- ADVANTAGES OF OOP --
//  Programming in an Object-oriented way can be used to develop code with a clearer and more modular organization in the following ways:
//  - implementation details abstracted away making code more readable (Abstraction)
//  - restricted access to various levels of abstraction, preventing data inconsistencies (Encapsulation)
//  - duplication minimized through inheritance hierarchies (Inheritance)
//  - flexible code where multiple implementations are swapped out behind a common interface (Polymorphism)
//-- THE FOUR PILLARS OF OOP --
//  1. Abstraction - keep it clean
//  2. Encapsulation - keep it contained
//  3. Inheritance - keep it hierarchical (DRY)
//  4. Polymorphism - keep it versatile

//Today we will focus on Abstraction and Encapsulation.
